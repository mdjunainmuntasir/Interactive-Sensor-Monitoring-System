# Interactive-Sensor-Monitoring-System

Description:OptiSense is a comprehensive hardware-software integration project designed to monitor environmental changes using an optical sensor, providing both visual and auditory feedback. The system controls an LED and buzzer based on sensor data, demonstrating real-time monitoring and event-driven response in embedded systems.
Key Features:
Optical Sensor Integration: Utilizes an optical sensor to detect object presence, switching between active and inactive states.
Real-Time Feedback: The LED lights up when the sensor is unblocked, and the buzzer sounds when the sensor is blocked.
User-Defined Operation: Allows the user to set a predefined duration or a number of activations to run the system.
LabJack U3 HV Integration: Controls input/output functions through the LabJack U3 HV, managing both digital and analog components.
Technologies Used:
Programming Language: C
Hardware: LabJack U3 HV, Optical Sensor, PWM LED, Buzzer
Circuit Design: Breadboard and PCB
Project Highlights:
Developed a system that reacts to sensor states with clear feedback using LEDs and buzzers.
Configured a PWM signal for controlling the buzzer.
Implemented event-based or time-based system termination, allowing for flexible operation.
